I'm an avid reader and learner who studied Latin with generous portions of history and philosophy on the side while in college. I've worked with commodity trading groups, conducted business case studies for relocating a small business across the country, and marketed intellectual property. I took steps towards a career in law and one in the foreign service, but eventually decided to pursue neither. I've dabbled in a number of fields but couldn't see myself making a career in any of them. In early 2017, I decided to develop the ad hoc programming skills I'd blundered my way into since high school as an entertaining hobby with potential professional value. Once I started, it didn't take me long to realize I'd stumbled into something I could see myself doing for the rest of my life.

Programming pushes me to use some of the skills I've found most rewarding during the previous stops in my journey. The steps I take to write code to accomplish a particular task go something like this:

1. Conceptualize the goal and clearly articulate what end result I seek to achieve with my program
2. Determine how to accomplish that goal (and write tests to create a framework for the process)
3. Writing the code (and figuring out exactly how I intend to construct the program, asking myself things like "Are there best practices to adhere to?" and "Why is the way I'm building this the right way for this project?")
4. Troubleshooting the code - error messages are wonderful things (and this is probably my favorite step of the process, since figuring out why the code that *should* work doesn't is especially rewarding)
5. Repeating steps 3 & 4 (and occasionally step 2) many times

All of the code I write pushes me through these steps, and I really enjoy all of them (which is why I love coding). Each program I write is an opportunity to optimize a solution to a new challenge with the tangible reward of a working program at the end. I'm finally on the train I want to be on, and don't see myself getting off of it any time soon.
