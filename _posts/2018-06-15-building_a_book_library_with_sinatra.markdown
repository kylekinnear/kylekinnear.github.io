Sinatra was an *interesting* experience for me. It took me forever and a day to finish the unit because of complications outside of programming. However, it was also the place where I really started writing code that functions similarly to websites I visit every day (even if Rails promises to expedite and streamline the process). Through the units since the end of the CLI project, SQL and ActiveRecord were big highlights, but understanding how routes work seems especially valuable.

I wanted to build something useful to me for my final project, so (naturally) I built a book library. Besides lending itself nicely to a CRUD app, being able to track the location of books between multiple ebook platforms, bookshelves, and the local library in addition to being able to keep any notes and thoughts on a given book nicely sorted made this project especially appealing.

Overall, I'm satisfied with but not excited about my project. I ended up cutting a couple of features that were taking too much time to implement so that I could move on to Rails (a flexible tags system and Goodreads integration) that I might revisit in the future. It's a little barebones as a result. I did learn a lot doing it, and look forward to seeing how I can build on that knowledge to create more robust web apps.
